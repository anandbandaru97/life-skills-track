# Tiny Habits
## What is the take away from first video?
Know your existing habit and after you do that task use this as trigger point to do another task.

## What is the take away from second video?
Here's the key takeaway from the video:

* `Behavior Change Matrix`: Motivation, Ability, and Prompts. He explains that for a behavior to occur, a person needs to have sufficient motivation, the ability to perform the behavior, and a prompt or trigger that cues the behavior.

* `Tiny Habits`: Fogg emphasizes the importance of starting with tiny habits—very small and easily achievable behaviors that are related to the larger behavior you want to establish. These tiny habits are designed to be so simple that you can't fail to do them.

* `Anchoring`: Fogg suggests anchoring new habits to existing routines or actions. This means piggybacking the new behavior onto something you already do consistently, which makes it easier to remember and integrate into your daily life.

* `Celebration`: One of the unique aspects of Fogg's approach is the emphasis on celebrating after completing a tiny habit. Celebrating could be as simple as saying "I did it!" or giving yourself a small treat. This positive reinforcement helps to wire the behavior into your brain.

* `B = MAP`: Fogg's formula for behavior change is: Behavior equals Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. According to this formula, in order to establish a behavior, you need the right combination of motivation, ability, and prompt.

* `Behavior Design`: The book outlines a systematic approach called "Behavior Design" to help you design new habits. This involves identifying the specific behavior you want to establish, breaking it down into smaller steps, and ensuring that you have the motivation, ability, and prompts to carry out each step.

* `Experimentation and Iteration`: Fogg encourages an experimental mindset, where you try different tiny habits and adjust as necessary based on your results. Not every tiny habit will work for everyone, so it's important to find what works best for you through trial and error.

* `Social Support`: The book also discusses the role of social support in behavior change. Sharing your tiny habit journey with others can provide accountability and encouragement.
## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?

Using the B = MAP formula, which stands for Behavior equals Motivation, Ability, and Prompt, can make it easier to create and establish new habits. This formula provides a structured approach to ensure that you have the necessary components in place for successful habit formation. Here's how you can use B = MAP to make creating new habits easier:

### 1. Motivation:

* `Identify Your Motivation`: Clearly define why you want to establish a new habit. What are the benefits you expect to gain? Understanding the underlying reasons for the habit can boost your motivation.
* `Connect to Emotions`: Make an emotional connection to the habit. How will it make you feel? Visualize the positive outcomes and emotions associated with the habit.

### 2. Ability:
* `Start Tiny`: Break down the habit into its smallest possible component. This ensures that the habit is easy to accomplish, reducing the mental and physical effort required.
* `Focus on Simplicity`: Ensure that the habit is so simple that you can do it even on your busiest days or when you're feeling low on energy.
* `Remove Barriers`: Identify and eliminate any obstacles that might hinder your ability to perform the habit. Set up your environment to make the habit as frictionless as possible.

### 3. Prompt:

* `Use Triggers`: Choose a specific trigger or prompt that will remind you to perform the habit. This trigger can be an existing routine, a specific time of day, or a visual cue.
* `Anchor to Existing Behavior`: Piggyback the new habit onto a behavior you already do consistently. This creates a natural link between the old and new behavior.
* `Use Visual Cues`: Place visual cues in your environment to remind you of the habit. This could be a sticky note, an image, or an object associated with the habit.

## Why is it important to shine or celebrate after winning?

Here's why celebrating is important:

* `Positive Reinforcement`: Celebrating creates a positive emotional response linked to the behavior you're trying to establish. When you feel good after completing a habit, your brain associates that good feeling with the behavior itself. This reinforcement strengthens the neural pathways associated with the habit.

* `Neurological Wiring`: Every time you celebrate, your brain releases feel-good chemicals like dopamine. This chemical response makes your brain more receptive to repeating the behavior in the future. Over time, the connection between the behavior and the positive emotion becomes stronger.

* `Boosts Self-Efficacy`: Consistently celebrating small wins builds your self-efficacy—the belief in your ability to achieve your goals. Each celebration is evidence that you can successfully perform the habit, boosting your confidence and motivation to continue.

* `Counteracts Negative Emotions`: Sometimes, habits can feel like a chore, especially when you're just starting. Celebrating helps counteract any negative feelings or resistance you might have towards the habit. It turns the experience into something enjoyable and fulfilling.

* `Anchors Habits in Memory`: Celebrations create a memorable experience around the habit. This can help you remember and look forward to the habit in the future. The memory of the positive emotion associated with the habit can serve as a powerful motivator.

* `Cultivates Joy and Mindfulness`: Celebrations encourage you to be mindful of your accomplishments and small victories. This mindfulness can extend beyond the habit itself, promoting a positive and joyful mindset in other areas of your life.

* `Sustains Long-Term Commitment`: Habit formation is a gradual process. Celebrations provide a continuous source of motivation and reinforcement, which is essential for staying committed over time.

## What are your take aways from 4th Video(1% better)?

Here are some key takeaways from the "1% Better" Video:

* `Small Steps Lead to Big Changes`: By focusing on making small improvements consistently, you can avoid feeling overwhelmed and create lasting change over time. Each small step contributes to your overall progress.

* `Continuous Improvement Mindset`: Embrace the mindset of constant growth and improvement. Instead of striving for perfection or drastic transformations, aim to make small, sustainable changes that accumulate over time.

* `Realistic and Achievable Goals`: Setting goals that are achievable in the short term increases your chances of success. The "1% Better" approach encourages setting manageable goals that you're more likely to accomplish.

* `Reduced Resistance and Overwhelm`: Small changes are less likely to trigger resistance or a sense of overwhelm. They fit more easily into your daily routine and are less likely to disrupt your existing habits.

* `Consistency is Key`: Consistency is more important than intensity. Commit to making small improvements consistently, and over time, these efforts will compound to create significant positive changes.

* `Focus on Process, Not Outcome`: Instead of solely fixating on the end result, concentrate on the process of improvement itself. Enjoy the journey and the progress you make along the way.

## Take aways from atomic habit book

The perspective on habit formation in the context of identity, processes, and outcomes is an insightful way to understand how habits are established, maintained, and integrated into one's life. 

### Identity:
BJ Fogg's approach to habit formation acknowledges the role of identity in shaping behaviors. He suggests that identifying as a person who performs a certain behavior can be a powerful driver of habit formation. When you integrate a behavior into your identity, it becomes a natural and intrinsic part of who you are.

* `Identity-Based Habits`: Instead of just aiming to perform a behavior, Fogg recommends aligning the behavior with your self-identity. For instance, rather than saying "I want to exercise," you would say "I am someone who prioritizes physical well-being." This shifts the focus from the action to the identity, making the behavior more ingrained.

* `Consistency with Values`: Fogg's approach also encourages aligning habits with your core values and beliefs. When a behavior resonates with your identity and values, it's more likely to be sustained as it reinforces a sense of authenticity.

### Processes:
Fogg emphasizes the importance of designing a clear and effective process for habit formation. He breaks down habit formation into a series of steps that involve motivation, ability, and prompts. These processes ensure that habits are established in a strategic and systematic manner.

* `Motivation and Ability Balancing`: The "Tiny Habits" methodology recognizes the balance between motivation and ability. To create a habit, you need sufficient motivation and the ability to perform the behavior. Starting with small, achievable steps ensures that the ability aspect is met, while the motivation is enhanced through celebration.

* `Anchoring and Prompting`: Fogg's approach incorporates prompts or triggers that initiate the behavior. Anchoring new habits to existing routines or actions makes it easier to remember and execute the behavior consistently. This process builds upon what you already do, creating a seamless integration of new habits.

### Outcomes:
Fogg's perspective on outcomes emphasizes that habits aren't solely about achieving a specific outcome but also about the process of behavior change itself. Outcomes are important, but focusing on the process and the journey enhances the likelihood of success and long-term habit sustainability.

* `Process-Oriented Mindset`: The "Tiny Habits" approach encourages embracing the journey of habit formation, rather than fixating solely on the end result. By celebrating small wins and gradual progress, the process itself becomes rewarding, leading to increased intrinsic motivation.

* `Shift in Outcomes`: Fogg's approach acknowledges that once the behavior becomes a habit, the outcomes might naturally shift. Initially, the goal might be weight loss, but over time, the outcome might evolve to feeling more energetic and confident. This adaptability ensures that the habit remains relevant and fulfilling.
