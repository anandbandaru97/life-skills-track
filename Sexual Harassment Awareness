**Verbal or Written Harassment:** This involves making derogatory comments, jokes, or remarks about a person's sex, gender, or sexual orientation and sending explicit or offensive messages.
**Physical Harassment:** Any unwanted physical contact, such as touching, groping, or brushing against someone's body without consent, falls into this category.
**Non-Verbal Harassment:** This includes leering, making inappropriate gestures, or displaying explicit or pornographic material in the workplace or public spaces.
**Hostile Work Environment:** Actions or behaviors that create an intimidating, offensive, or hostile atmosphere due to their sexual nature, etc.

If you face or witness incidents of sexual harassment, it's essential to take appropriate action. Here are some steps you can consider:

**Situation Assessment:** Decide if immediate action is required to ensure personal or other safety involved. If necessary, remove the person being harassed from the problem.
**Event Records:** Keep a record of the incidents, including dates, times, locations, details of what occurred, and any witnesses present. This will be helpful if you decide to report it later.
**Personal Support:** Share the incidents with a trusted colleague, supervisor, friend, or family member who can provide support and advice on how to proceed.
**Follow Internal Policies:** If you are in a workplace setting, familiarize yourself with the organization's policies and procedures for reporting sexual harassment. Report the incidents to the appropriate person or department as outlined in those policies.
**Seek External Assistance:** If the harassment occurs outside of a workplace, consider contacting local Police or relevant authorities, to report the incidents.
**Seek Professional Support:** If anyone involved needs emotional support or counseling, consider reaching out to a professional counselor or support helpline that specializes in dealing with issues related to sexual harassment.

Remember, addressing sexual harassment requires taking action and supporting those affected. It is essential to create a culture that respects the rights and dignity of all individuals.
